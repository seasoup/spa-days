general:
    x search for $.attr(...).
      In most cases, it should be replaced with prop(...).
    x rename collection from 'user' to 'users'
    x global check for console.log/warn/error/trace
public/js/spa.js:
    x on catch( error ), use console.trace( error ) instead of
    console.error( error ) (preferred) or removed try-catch altogether
public/js/spa.chat.js:
    x We can now switch between users when chatting.
    x We now update the chat title to indicate who the chatee is.
    x Chat list is now much prettier and integrated
    x The chat text now distinguish between *you* and a remote user (you
    in bold at present)
    x The chat pane does now auto-scrolls to the bottom.
    x Send button now works in addition to hitting return
    x clean syntax (autoformat)
    x Bold for user should be different color.  Implement style
      (spa-chat-msg-mine or similar) for my owned chats
    x 'to chat alone' quote should be placed in div for padding
    => add user icon next to chatters
    x Remove 'whats your name' code from here and move to 'login' in shell
    x Implement hidden for chat; hide chat unless logged in.
    => implement timestamp?
    => have [x] button disconnect from current chat
public/js/spa.data.js:
    x move createUser example to after code
public/js/spa.model.js:
    x line 32 - remove console.log
    x removed //TODO use taffy here notes -these are OOD
    x do we still need people_id_map?  If not, delete.
    => write API doc per how things actually work.  Show chronologically.
public/js/spa.shell.js:
    x remove spa.chatlist config / init (do global search)
    x remove beforeunload code
    x replaced onbeforeunload event with disconnect.
      this is much more reliable and efficient.
    x restyle to look less cartoonish
    x add login function here
public/css/spa.chat.css:
    x make window 32em instead of 30em wide
    x round TL chat-list-box corner 0.2em
    x clean syntax (autoformat)
public/css/spa.shell.css
    x restyle to look less cartoonish
lib/crud.js:
    x fixed update to work against multiple docs
    x mixed module camelCase and lower_case modules names,
      fix to all camelCase.
    x add note: crud 'create' was switched to 'make' because 'create' is a
      reserved method on the prototype object.  Ditto 'delete'.
    x confirm JSV is working in crud.js
package.json:
    x bump SPA version to 0.0.2.
    x rename to 'SPA example'
    x clean syntax (autoformat)
design.txt:
    => delete (supplant by spa.model.js)
README.txt
    => add this and point to public/js/spa.model.js for docs
