general:
    o search for $.attr(...).
      In most cases, it should be replaced with prop(...).
    x rename collection from 'user' to 'users'
public/js/spa.js:
    o on catch( error ), use console.trace( error ) instead of
    console.error( error ) (preferred) or removed try-catch altogether
public/js/spa.chat.js:
    x We can now switch between users when chatting.
    x We now update the chat title to indicate who the chatee is.
    x Chat list is now much prettier and integrated
    x The chat text now distinguish between *you* and a remote user (you
    in bold at present)
    x The chat pane does now auto-scrolls to the bottom.
    x Send button now works in addition to hitting return
    o add user icon next to chatters
    o clean syntax (autoformat)
    o Remove 'whats your name' code from here and move to 'login' in shell
    o Implement hidden for chat; hide chat unless logged in.
    o Bold for user should be different color.  Implement style
      (spa-chat-msg-mine or similar) for my owned chats
    o implement timestamp?
    o 'to chat alone' quote should be placed in div for padding
    o have [x] button disconnect from current chat
public/js/spa.data.js:
    o move createUser example to after code
public/js/spa.model.js:
    o write API doc per how things actually work.  Show chronologically.
    o removed //TODO use taffy here notes -these are OOD
    o do we still need people_id_map?  If not, delete.
public/js/spa.shell.js:
    o remove spa.chatlist config / init (do global search)
    o add login function here
    o restyle to look less cartoonish
    o remove beforeunload code
    x replaced onbeforeunload event with disconnect.
      this is much more reliable and efficient.
public/css/spa.chat.css:
    o make window 35em instead of 30em wide
    o consider rounding TL chat-list-box corner 0.2em
    o clean syntax (autoformat)
public/css/spa.shell.css
    o restyle to look less cartoonish
lib/crud.js:
    x fixed update to work against multiple docs
    x mixed module camelCase and lower_case modules names,
      fix to all camelCase.
    x add note: crud 'create' was switched to 'make' because 'create' is a
      reserved method on the prototype object.  Ditto 'delete'.
    x confirm JSV is working in crud.js
package.json:
    x bump SPA version to 0.0.2.
    x rename to 'SPA example'
    x clean syntax (autoformat)
design.txt:
    o delete (supplant by spa.model.js)
